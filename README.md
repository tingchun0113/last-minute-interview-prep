  <summary>Sample answer</summary>

  I'm open to discussing what you believe to be a fair salary for the position. However, based on my previous salary, my knowledge of   the industry, and my understanding of this geographic area, I'd expect a salary in the general range of $X to $Y. Again, I'm open to discussing these numbers with you.

## Questions to ask interviewers
:warning: Different types of questions are suitable for asking in different situations (e.g. recruiters or senior management). Some sample questions to ask (more questions to [ask](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/final-questions/)):

* What are the company's highest priority goals this year, and how would my role contribute?
* What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 90 days?
* What's the process? next steps?
* Lastly, if no other questions:

  * Well, I don't have any other questions right now, but I do just want to say that I was really interested in this opportunity before we had this chance, and I'm a hundred times more excited about it now. I want you to know that I really, really want this job.
