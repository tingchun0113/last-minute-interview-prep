# Last-minute interview prep
Ready for a job interview but haven't had one in years? This file is designed to help people review the most frequently asked questions in **minutes**.

Below is a list of questions I've been asked in my past interviews. If you find any frequently asked questions not listed here, send in a PR!

## The basics
* Job titles / descriptions
* Company info / products / services (Website / LinkedIn / Crunchbase)
* Tell me about yourself
* Your strengths and weaknesses
* Why are you leaving your current job? 
* Why this industry / company / role? 
* What are you looking for in your next role?
* Logistics (visa; when are you able to start?)

## What's your expected salary?

  <summary>Sample answer</summary>
  <br>
  I'm open to discussing what you believe to be a fair salary for the position. However, based on my previous salary, my knowledge of   the industry, and my understanding of this geographic area, I'd expect a salary in the general range of $X to $Y. Again, I'm open to discussing these numbers with you.

  * had a conflict (with your manager/a team member)
  * met a tight deadline
  * failed at work
  * received constructive feedback

## Questions to ask interviewers
:warning: Different types of questions are appropriate to ask in different situations (e.g. hiring managers or senior management). Some sample questions to ask (more questions to [ask](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/final-questions/)):

* What are the company's highest priority goals this year, and how would my role contribute?
* What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 90 days?
* What's the process? next steps?
* Lastly, if no other questions:

  * Well, I don't have any other questions right now, but I do just want to say that I was really interested in this opportunity before we had this chance, and I'm a hundred times more excited about it now. I want you to know that I really, really want this job.
